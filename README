Einspline B-spline library
--------------------------
libeinspline is intended to be a simple, fast, and accurate library
for creating and evaluation interpolating B-splines.  In supports
splines in 1D, 2D, and 3D, with real and complex datatypes in single
or double precision.  It supports spline with uniform on nonuniform
knot spacing.  When many splines need to be evaluated a single point,
it has specialized routines to speed the calculations.

Building
--------
einspline is built with the standard autotools sequence:
1)  ./configure --option1 ...
2)  make
3)  make install

Options
-------
Einspline contains hand-coded routines to take advantage of SSE, SSE2,
and SSE3 instructions.  To enable their use, use
  ./configure --enable-sse
Some routines make optional use of software prefetching, which helps 
on some processors and may hurt on others.  It is enabled by
passing "--enable-prefetch" to configure.


Known issues:
   GCC 4.0.2 (and perhaps earlier versions) has a known bug in
generating optimized SSE code on 32-bit machines.  The results of
using the SSE version may not be correct.  We suggest upgrading to the
4.1 or 4.2 line of gcc or using the Intel compiler, which is free on
Linux for noncommercial use.  Alternatively, disable the SSE routines.
