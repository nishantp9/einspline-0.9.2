<h1>B-spline Background</h1>
Some introductory background on interpolating B-splines and their construction can be
found <a href="background.shtml">here</a>.

<h1> Installation </h1>
<p><font color="blue"> einspline</font> is written in standard C
conforming to the C99 standard.  To install it, you will need a
compiler which supports this standard.  It uses
autoconf/automake/libtool for installation, but these are not required
to build the library.  The following is a quick set of instructions
for installing einspline.</p>
<ol>
  <li> Download the source from <a
  href="http://einspline.sourceforge.net"> here </a>. </li>
  <li> Unpack the tarball with a command such as <br>
       <pre> tar xvpzf einspline-0.5.tar.gz </pre> </li>
  <li> <b>cd</b> to the einspline root directory.
  <li> Automatically configure for your machine by running the
       <b>configure</b> script. <br/>
       <pre>  ./configure</pre>
  <li> For more configuration options run: <br/>
       <pre>  ./configure --help</pre>
       For example, to configure the library to be installed in your
       home directory (such as on a supercomputer where you do not
       have root access), run
       <pre>  ./configure --prefix=$HOME </pre>
  <li> To take maximum advantage of SSE instructions, configure
       with "--enable-sse"
  <li> To utilize software prefetch (in some routines) use
       "--enable-prefetch".  This improves speed significantly
       on some processors and hurts on others.
  <li> Build the library with 
       <pre>  make </pre>
  <li> Finally, install the library with
       <pre>  make install </pre>
</ol>
      
<h1> Library API </h1>     
<h2> C interface </h2>
libbspline organizes spline routines into two groups:  those which are
specified on a uniform grid (or multidimensional mesh), and those on
nonuniform grids.  The uniform versions of the routines are documented
below, followed by the nonuniform versions.

<h3><a href="UBinterface.shtml"> Single uniform Splines </a></h3>
<h3><a href="multiUBinterface.shtml"> Multiple uniform Splines </a></h3>
<h3><a href="NUBinterface.shtml"> Single nonuniform Splines </a></h3>

<h2> FORTRAN 77 interface </h2>
<h3><a href="F77uniform.shtml">    Single uniform splines    </a></h3>
<h3><a href="F77multi.shtml">    Multiple uniform splines    </a></h3>
<h3><a href="F77nonuniform.shtml"> Single nonuniform splines </a></h3>
