<h2> 1/18/08 </h2>
Releasing einspline-0.8.0.  This release contains new functions which, for a 
given evaluation point, evaluate a whole set of splines with a single
evaluation call.  For large numbers of splines, this can result in
a very significant speedup -- in some cases 4x!  The functions are
very similar to the single-spline version.  Only uniform multi-splines
have been implemented so far.
<h2> 10/31/07 </h2>
einspline-0.7.7 was released today.  It fixes an off-by-one error in the 
construction of nonuniform B-spline bases.
<h2> 5/11/07 </h2>
Today, einspline 0.6 will be released today.  This release includes Fortran 77
wrappers to the C library.
<h2> 5/8/07 </h2>
einspline-0.5 was released today.  This is the initial public release
of the library.  I have tested it, but not extensively.  Please report
any bugs to kpesler AT ciw DOT edu.
